<h2>Project Info</h2>
  <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
    design a technological intervention to preserve memories of redeveloped communities in China
    </p>
  <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>Lusi Wang , Jing Qian, Niharika Ved</p>
  <h3>Advisers</h3>
    <p>Robert Goodspeed, Clifford Lampe</p>
  <h3>Length</h3>
    <p>7 months</p>

<h2>My Role</h2>
<ul>
  <li>led a multi-disciplinary and multi-cultural team</li>
  <li>planned  survey, contextual inquiry, feasibility evaluation, and usability testing</li>
  <li>created  paper prototype, wire-frame, and high-fi prototype (Balsamiq / Xd)</li>
  <li>co-designed the user-flow diagram and the presentation poster (Illustrator)</li>
  <li>1st author and primary presenter at CHI 2018</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<h3>Challenge</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How to preserve the past living of inner-city communities during rapid urbanization in China? This is an urgent but ambiguous question.</li>
  <li>The main difficulty of this project comes from navigating through such ambiguity.</li>
  <li>Urgent: history is disappearing right in front of our eyes.</li>
  <li>Ambiguous: while lamenting the loss, most stakeholders, including community members view development as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Understand and define</h3>
UNDERSTAND AND DEFINE
<p>I approached this ambiguous problem with a full set of user research tools to find out who can contribute to preserving community memory.
It took our team 3 months, visiting 3 neighborhoods, interviewing 12 professions, to identify 4 key stakeholders — preservation specialists, motivated individuals, local residents, and the general public.
The methods we used include literature review, pilot survey, ethnography, interview, affinity analysis, and competitor analysis. To know details on each method, please see the extended abstract.</p>

<h3>Ideate</h3>
<p>
// image of brainstorming and sketch. It turns out these four stakeholders has complementary sources and needs.
Therefore, we aimed for design solutions that connects the 4 stakeholders together for preservation.
Our team came up with total 26 ideas in 30-minute brainstorming sessions.
Then we scored and ranked all the solutions using weighted criteria based on previous research.
For the top-ranked ideas, I led the team to analyze their commonalities and differences.
I then translated top solutions to storyboards.</p>

<h3>Develop Narrative</h3>
<p>
// image of user journey analysis. I created a persona for every stakeholder along with an anti-persona.
This allowed the team to empathize with stakeholders’ complex desires, needs, and resources.
To maintain a big picture while designing for 4 stakeholders, I started a story map.
The story map is consisted of a story line for each persona with their intersections highlighted.
As the team jumping into the sea of prototypes, we updated the story map and ended up with 6 major iterations.</p>

<h3>Prototype & Test</h3>
<p>
// embeded links to low-fi, mid-fi, and high-fi prototype (interactive)
I integrated usability testing throughout the prototyping process, starting with a paper prototype of the wireframe.
After gathering the feedback, I updated interactions in the mid-fidelity prototype based on previous testing.
The same procedure happened from mid-fidelity to high-fidelity.
Such iterative process crystallized the core of our design solution — enabling people who know community history to share it in public spaces.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
// a illustration showing user flows and interaction process
The final solution contains 3 types of user — facilitators, presenters, and audience.
Supported by the Urban Memory mobile application, stakeholders come together to tell and hear community history in public spaces.
The 3 user flows are established based on resources, needs, and motivations of 4 key stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>
It’s a rare opportunity that I get to engage with the full research and design process.
This allowed me to integrate research results and methodology throughout the whole design process for our team.
Since the problem is a social one, usability testing for the mobile APP is not enough.
If given longer time and more resources, we will test out how a storytelling event would function in reality.</p>
